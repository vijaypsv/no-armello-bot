# No armello bot

Discord bot that shows an image a brief description of a H.P.Lovecraft character. For now, it only works in spanish. 

The source of all the information that the bot responds is https://hplovecraft.fandom.com/es, the spanish fandom page for H.P. Lovecraft.
It uses the mediawiki API to extract the image and there is a little bit of webscrapping to get the description.

# Instalation

Edit the build.sh to add the discord bot token and then run the script. It will create a container with the bot
